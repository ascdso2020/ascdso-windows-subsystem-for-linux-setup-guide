#### Change log 2/8/2019:

##### GitHub:

* Added "embedded" video into video section.
  - This is actually link wrapped around an image tag of the first youtube video. It will show like a video, but opens up to youtube.
    - Also, need to find out how a click on it opens in a new tab. _blank doesn't work here.

* Cleaned up the flow and organization of the main entry doc.
  - Removed the bottom section ( essentially the credits, updates/versioning section ) into it's own doc.
  - Moved the "Begin here" section to the bottom of the doc where it is more expected to be.
  - Added a checklist section to allow users to track their progress along with the guide.

* Added gh-pages branch to host the checklist.

##### YouTube:

* Cleaned up and standardized the language between all videos to become more consistant.
* Added a new thumbnail image to each video to better identify which video is which.
* Named the videos as follows:
  - Part 1: Introduction into WSL
  - Part 2: Setting up WSL
  - Part 3: WSL Work-Flow and Software.
* Re-arragned the way the videos are listed on the channel so that they show up in order from 1 - 3.
* Organized the playlist for better quality and discoverablility.
* Updated the channel description to better convey the intent of the channel, and the videos within it.

### Upcoming Additions:

#### Release date: 1/19

**Keep an eye out for an update! I will be working on this over the next few days and hope to have it completed by 1/13 or 1/20!**

Update: I will be updating this guide very soon now! I have been so busy with the Microsoft LEAP program, a job transition, as well as with learning C++ and C# that I haven't spent any time with WSL since July! Having said that, there are quite a few upcoming additions to this guide which will help with quality of life, guide readability, new vidoes, annotations, checklists, clairifications, and hopefully an exploration into any new major features!

Most importantly, I will be shoring up some areas that may be a struggle for new students and others new to WSL. One of the big ones is on how to use things like NPM for NodeJS: Where does global live, and how you should use it with the WSL workflow?

I will also be creating a requested video where I go through making an entire basic web app to show what the workflow looks like in a real life scenario!

Please make sure to request any thing else you would like to see and I will try to get it into the guide!

### Past Additions:

#### 7/18:

- Getting new laptop on 7/1/18 and will update the doc in that month. ( Update coming soon! Videos will be included! Minor bug fixes! Delayed due to catcing a cold :feelsgood: :mask:. (DONE!)
- More links to all the resources that are used.
- Video demos, screen shots, and gifs to help visualize what's going on.
