# Windows Subsystem for Linux Setup

## Notice:

WSL 2 is out! I have not had a chance to look at it yet, but I expect that this guide will need another round of updates to account for these changes!

The Windows Subsystem for Linux feature on Windows 10 enables users to have a Linux enviroment fully integrated into their Windows PC.

For ~~experienced~~ all developers: This is not a VM, a Dual-boot, or a console wrapper like Git Bash or Cygwin. It is a native POSIX environment directly mounted to your Windows File System.

## Video Guide:

This guide also has a video walkthrough of it on YouTube where it goes into great detail on each section to help provide you with as much context as possible.

It's recommended you watch the videos while you go through this guide as they will help clairify many of these points with visuals.
